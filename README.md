## Etiquette 

### Be nice and respectful 

This is a good rule wherever you are. 

If there is someone who isn't behaving well or makes you uncomfortable, be honest with them if you can. If you are uncomfortable doing that or feel the person isn't being receptive, DM an admin and let them know:

Yvonne Liu: @yvonne  
Dan Sofer: @dan  
Bobby Sebolao: @bobby

For more information, please read our complete [Code of Conduct](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/slack/).

### Take a look around

Joining a Slack channel is a lot like walking into a room. Don't just walk in and start talking.

Before you start typing, take a look around. See if there is a conversation that is going on. If there is something happening, wait a few minutes to see if the conversation dies down. If not, you can wait until later or simply post a short message to let people know why you joined and what you'd like to discuss/get help with. A lot of times someone will help you out in a DM or another channel.


### @here vs @channel vs @mention

If you want to notify everyone about something important, you should generally use `@here`. This will send a notification to anyone who is in the channel and currently online. You should only use this if you really need everyone online to see your message.

`@channel` will send a notification to **everybody in the channel**, whether they're online or not. You probably won't ever need to use this.

You can notify a single person directly with `@mention`. Before you do this consider what timezone they are in and if you are likely to disturb them. You can check someone's timezone in their profile.

If you post outside of working hours for a team, be patient, they will get back to you once the sun comes up.

### Use public channels to ask the admins questions

Slack is about communication, so please use the public channels whenever possible. This is good for transparency, but also keeps the community vibrant and alive. You also have an opportunity to help someone else who might find your conversation/question helpful or encouraging.

Please also be sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/about/) on our website, some of your questions may already be answered there! 

### Unsolicited private messages (DMs)

While the community aims to be a place for members of the community to meet and connect, it's also important to respect each other's privacy. Please first ask publicly if you may contact them privately before sending unsolicited messages.

### Format your messages

Slack supports bold, italics, code blocks and other formatting. You can use this to make your messages clearer to others. Code blocks especially are helpful when asking for help with your code. Read [Slack's guide on formatting](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages) for more information.


## Channels 

### #announcements 

Everyone will be automatically added into this channel. Admins will have posting priveleges. This is a good place to watch to have most up-to-date information on meetups and workshops. 

### #london

Everyone will be automtically added into this channel. Everyone can post in this channel. This is a good place to get to know other applicants, ask coding related questions, or ask the admins on anything. 

### #season-year-applicants 

Take a browse at our list of channels and find the cohort you're interested in applying. We organise our cohorts by season-year-applicants. For example, if you're interested in applying for the Summer 2020 cohort, the channel name will be `#summer-2020-applicants`:
