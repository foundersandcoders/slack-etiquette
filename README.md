## Etiquette 

### Be Nice and respectful 

This is a good rule wherever you are. 

If there is someone who isn't behaving well or makes you uncomfortable, be honest with them if you can.
If you are uncomfortable doing that or feel the person isn't being receptive, DM an admin and let them know:

Yvonne Liu: @yvonne  
Dan Sofer: @dan  
Bobby Sebolao: @bobby

For more information, please read our complete [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SparkPost/sparkpost.github.io/blob/develop/CodeofConduct.md).

### Take a look around

Joining a Slack channel is a lot like walking into a room. Don't just walk in and start talking.

Before you start typing, take a look around. See if there is a conversation that is going on.
If there is something happening, wait a few minutes to see if the conversation dies down. If not,
you can wait until later or simply post a short message to let people know why you joined and what you'd like
to discuss/get help with. A lot of times someone will help you out in a DM or another channel.


### Pay attention to time zones and be respectful of peoples' time

People on Slack are distributed and might be in a very different time zone from you, so don't use `@channel`
`@here`. Before you @-mention someone, think about what timezone they are in and if you are likely to disturb them.
You can check someone's timezone in their profile.

If you post in off hours for a team, be patient, they will get back to you once the sun comes up.

### Use public channels to ask the admins questions

Slack is about communication, so please use the public channels whenever possible. This is good for transparency,
but also keeps the community vibrant and alive. You also have an opportunity to help someone else who might find your conversation/question helpful or encouraging.

<!-- ### Asking for Help

If you join a channel or team looking for help, keep a few things in mind:

* State your problem clearly and succinctly, including what you've already tried
* Be patient and polite
* Don't expect someone to do you work for you. They may just point you in the right direction.

Most people are helping you because they want to, not because they have to, so being polite goes a long way! -->

### Learn some markdowns! 

Slack is a great starting point to learning markdowns, especially how to send blocks of code:
